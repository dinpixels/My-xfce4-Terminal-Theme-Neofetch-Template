# My xfce4 Theme Template
Uses oh-my-posh and applies the catppuccin theme to the xfce4 terminal.  
This template can be copy-pasted to user's directory assuming they already have oh-my-posh installed.

I have nothing to do if anything breaks in your end. Proceed only if you know what you're doing.
